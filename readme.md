## Disclaimer

This repository contains an experimental component library for Dioxus, derived from our internal work and needs.
We are sharing it with the community as-is, so you can explore, adapt, and build upon our work.

Please note:

* Not production ready:
    * This library is provided for experimental and educational purposes only. It is not designed for production use.

* Community-driven evolution:
    * We are offering it to the community as a starting point. Feel free to fork, modify, and enhance it in your own repositories.

* Limited maintenance commitment:
    * We commit to reviewing any pull requests related to bugs, improvements, and component additions until July 2025.
After that date, we are not guaranteeing to manage or support any future developments in this library.

* No major development planned:
    * We do not intend to invest significant further development in this project.

* Respecting the official ecosystem:
    * Our goal is not to compete with the upcoming official Dioxus component library. We fully support the evolution of the Dioxus ecosystem and see our contribution as complementary and a helping hand.

We hope that this initiative serves as a useful resource and inspiration for your projects!
